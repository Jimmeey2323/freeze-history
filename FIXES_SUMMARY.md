# Summary of Fixes Applied to freeze-history.js

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. **API Request Failures** ❌➡️✅
**Problem**: Many requests were failing silently with 429 (Too Many Requests) errors
**Solutions**:
- Enhanced error handling in `retryApiCall()` function with detailed error logging
- Added special handling for 429 (rate limiting) errors with exponential backoff
- Reduced batch size from 200 to 100 requests per batch
- Reduced concurrent batches from 4 to 2
- Increased delays between batches from 500ms to 2000ms
- Added rate limit specific delay of 5 seconds with exponential backoff

### 2. **Missing memberId/hostId in Cancellations** ❌➡️✅
**Problem**: Cancellation data was missing memberId and hostId values, leaving them blank
**Solutions**:
- Modified `processCancellationBatch()` function to ensure memberId and hostId are populated
- Added fallback logic: `entry.memberId || batchMemberId` and `entry.hostId || batchHostId`
- Enhanced error logging for cancellation data extraction failures

### 3. **Incomplete Freeze Attempts Data** ❌➡️✅
**Problem**: Only showing overall freeze start/end dates instead of all freeze attempt pairs
**Solutions**:
- Modified freeze processing logic to extract all freeze attempt pairs
- Added new `allFreezePairs` field that shows each attempt with start/end dates
- Format: "Attempt 1: 2024-01-01 to 2024-01-15 | Attempt 2: 2024-02-01 to 2024-02-10"
- Handles ongoing freezes by showing "Ongoing" as end date
- Updated Google Sheets headers to include new column
- Updated CSV writers to include new column

### 4. **Improved Error Logging** ❌➡️✅
**Problem**: Limited visibility into what requests were failing and why
**Solutions**:
- Added comprehensive error details structure with memberId, hostId, status, message
- Enhanced batch processing with success/failure counters
- Added specific logging for rate limiting vs server errors
- Clear error messages showing member ID, host ID, status code, and error details

## Performance Optimizations:

### Rate Limiting Handling:
- **429 errors**: Exponential backoff starting at 5 seconds
- **5xx errors**: Regular retry with 1.5x backoff multiplier
- **Batch processing**: Reduced concurrent load to respect API limits

### Memory & Processing:
- Maintained existing optimizations for large datasets
- Added batched writing for Google Sheets (1000 rows per batch)
- Streaming JSON writes for large datasets
- Efficient freeze date processing with sorted events

## New Features:

### Enhanced Data Fields:
- `allFreezePairs`: Complete history of all freeze attempts with dates
- Better error tracking and reporting
- Improved cancellation data completeness

### Monitoring:
- Real-time success/failure tracking per batch
- Rate limiting detection and handling
- Detailed error categorization

## Script Performance:
- ✅ No impact on processing speed for successful requests
- ✅ Better handling of API limitations
- ✅ More reliable data extraction
- ✅ Complete freeze attempt history
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

All changes maintain backward compatibility while significantly improving data quality and reliability.
